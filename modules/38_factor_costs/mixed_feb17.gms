*' @description This 'mixed' realization specifies factors costs to depend on
*' area harvested and agricultural land use intensity and corresponding average
*' production volumes.
*' Consequently, factor costs in this realization react on both: area under
*' production and average productivity of a region as captured by the $\tau$
*' factor. A detailed description of the approach can be found
*' in @dietrich_forecasting_2014 with background information about the used
*' intensity measure in @dietrich_measuring_2012.
*'
*' @limitations This realization assumes that factor costs only depend on area
*' and average productivity of a region. Productivity differences within a
*' region are ignored. Therefore, cases in which the cellular productivity
*' levels affect factors costs are only partially accounted for.
