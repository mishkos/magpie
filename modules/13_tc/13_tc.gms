*' @title Technological change
*'
*' @description The technological change (TC) module describes the relation
*' between agricultural land use intensity represented by the $\tau$ factor and
*' the costs which have to be paid for further intensification (technological
*' change costs). Besides cropland expansion ([39_landconversion]) and trade
*' ([21_trade]), it describes the third major option of the model to increase
*' regional supply. In order to calculate this relation, the module needs to
*' receive information about the assumed interest rate and assumed investment
*' horizon currently provided by module [12_interest_rate].
*'
*' Calculated $\tau$ factors are then used for yields calculation by [14_yields]
*' and by [38_factor_costs] for the calculation of factor costs.
