*' @description The static realisation is very simple and does not include any equation 
*' because forestry land is assumed constant at the observed 1995 level throughout time. 

*' @limitations Forestry activities such as establishment or 
*' harvest of plantations for wood production are not modeled. 
*' Also afforestation for CDR is not included.
