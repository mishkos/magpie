****** Costs ******
*------------------

*' The direct costs of Timber production and afforestation `vm_cost_fore` include
*' maintenance and monitoring costs for newly established plantations as well as
*' standing plantations '[@sathaye_ghg_2005]. In addition, this type of forest management
*' (including afforestation) may cause costs in other parts of the model such as costs
*' for technological change [13_tc] or land expansion [39_landconversion]. Also included
*' are additional costs for producing timber from extremely highly managed plantations
*' which are analogous to intensification using technological change from [13_tc] but
*' in a parametrized form.

*' policies are counted towards the maximum defined in `p32_max_aff_area`.
*' Therefore, the right-hand side of the constraint is tightened by the value of

**** Cost calculations
*---------------------

*' Cost of new plantations establishment `v32_cost_establishment` is the investment
*' made in setting up new plantations but also accounts for the expected value of
*' future harvesting costs. This makes sure that the model sticks to reasonable plantation
*' patterns over time. Present value of harvesting costs is (1+`pm_interest`)^`p32_rotation_regional`
*' and annuity factor of `pm_interest`/(1+`pm_interest`) averages the cost of this
*' investment over time.

						=e=

            +sum(cell(i2,j2), v32_land(j2,"plant","ac0") * pc32_yield_forestry_future(j2) * s32_harvesting_cost)

              )
            * sum(ct,pm_interest(ct,i2)/(1+pm_interest(ct,i2)));


*' Recurring costs are paid for plantations where the trees have to be regularly monitored
*' and maintained. These costs are only calculated becuase we see active human intervention
*' in commercial plantations. These costs are paid for trees used for timber production or
*' trees established for afforestation purposes.

**** New establishment decision
*------------------------------
*' New plantations are already established in the optimization step based on a certain
*' percentage (`pc32_plant_prod_share_future`) of future demand (`pm_demand_forestry_future`)
*' This is based on the expected future yield (`pc32_yield_forestry_future`) at
*' harvest (year in time step are accounted for).
*' Here we define three constraints for establishing new plantation in simulation step

*' Global maximum constraint based on meeting all the future timber demand (`pm_demand_forestry_future`).
