*' @description The main feature of the this realization is afforestation 
*' for CDR. Afforestation can be modelled
*' exogenously (prescribed by NPI/NDC policies) and/or endogenously 
*' (incentivized by a reward for CDR). National policies implemented (NPI) and 
*' nationally determined contributions to the Paris agreement (NDC) for afforestation 
*' are based on country reports. The interface `vm_cdr_aff` includes the expected CDR 
*' from afforestation depending on the planning horizon `s32_planing_horizon`.
*' The reward for CDR from afforestation is calculated in the [56_ghg_policy] module.
*' In this realization, afforestation is modeled by default as regrowth 
*' of natural vegetation (see @humpenoder_investigating_2014 for details on the implemenation). 
*' The regrowth of natural vegetation follows S-shaped growth curves, which are  parametrized
*' based on @braakhekke_modelling_2019.
*' Note that existing forestry plantations in 1995 dedicated to wood production are assumed constant throughout time. 

*' @limitations Forestry activities such as establishment or 
*' harvest of plantations for wood production are not modeled.
