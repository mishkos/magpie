*' @description
*' In the global_static_aug18 realization, per hectare land conversion costs are separated into 
*' costs for expansion of cropland, pasture and forestry (establishment costs) and 
*' costs for clearing of primary forest, secondary forest and other natural land (clearing costs).
*' We assume a global cost factor of 8000 USD/ha (static over time) for establishment of managed land. 
*' For clearing of natural vegetation we assume a global static cost factor of 5 USD/tC (based on @kreidenweis_pasture_2018). 
*'
*' @limitations Data availability for land conversion costs is very limited.
