*' @title Yields
*'
*' @description The yields module simulates the temporal development of crop
*' yields and pasture productivity. Spatially explicit information on pasture
*' productivity and crop yields under both rainfed and irrigated conditions is
*' provided by the global gridded crop model LPJmL (Lund-Potsdam-Jena with
*' managed Land) [@bondeau_lpjml_2007]. In the initial year of the simulation
*' period, crop yields and pasture productivity are calibrated at the regional
*' level to meet the observed cropland and pasture area as reported by FAO
*' [@FAOSTAT]. For the simulation of the temporal development of agricultural
*' yields, the module receives information about the agricultural land use
*' intensity represented by the $\tau$ factor coming from the module [13_tc].
*'
*' The module returns yields for all crops and for pasture, which is then used
*' by the modules [30_crop] and [31_past].
