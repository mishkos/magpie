*' The used first generation bioenergy trajectory contains demand until 2050
*' based on currently established and planned bioenergy policies
*' (@lotze-campen_impacts_2014). For the time
*' after 2050 it is assumed that bioenergy production will be fully transformed
*' to 2nd generation bioenergy crops and residues because of their higher
*' estimated efficiency respectively their low costs.
*'
*' For second generation bioenergy (`kbe60` = bioenergy grasses and bioenergy
*' trees), input is given either on regional or global level (defined via switch
*' $c60\_biodem\_level$). As the bioenergy demand for all crop types was fixed in the
*' first step it now has to be released again for second generation bioenergy
*' crops (`kbe60`).

*relax boundaries for all crops which belong to kbe60 as their demand is
*calculated separately (see equations)

vm_dem_bioen.lo(i,kbe60) = 0;

*' Relax the upper bound for residues.
