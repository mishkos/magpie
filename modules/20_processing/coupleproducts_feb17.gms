*' @description This realization describes the conversion process of primary to secondary agricultural products.
*' Secondary products are produced through some sort of mechanical or chemical processing
*' of primary crops. By secondary products we only refer to those for which information is 
*' available in Commodity Balance sheet of @FAOSTAT.
*' Among others, press cakes from oil production, molasses and bagasses
*' from sugar refinement and brans from cereal milling are important ones.
*' The use of these secondary products is given in the [16_demand] module.

*' @limitations Costs of processing depend on unit costs of processing 
*' collected, interpolated, extrapolated, and adjusted from a scant literature.
