*' @description The price_sep16 realization applies pollutant prices to different 
*' emission types depending on the emission pricing policy defined in `f56_emis_policy`. 
*' In addition, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from afforestation [32_forestry] is 
*' rewarded depending on the afforestation incentive policy defined in `f56_aff_policy`.
*' For CO2 emissions from land-use change and CDR from afforestation, the growth rate 
*' of the CO2 price is used to annuitize associated emission costs.
*' If pollutant prices are zero, which is the default for reference scenarios without 
*' mitigation, total emission costs entering the objective function are zero.
